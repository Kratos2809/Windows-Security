# Malware File Detector

This program scans a directory to detect potentially malicious files using:
- Hash calculation (MD5 and SHA-256)
- VirusTotal API for file verification

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your VirusTotal API key:
```
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

```bash
python malware_scanner.py [directory_path]
```

If no path is specified, the program will scan the current directory.

## Important Note
You need to obtain a free API key from [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us) to use this program.
